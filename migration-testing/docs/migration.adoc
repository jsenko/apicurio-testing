= Migration from {registry} {registry-v2} to 3.x

[role="_abstract"]
{registry} 3.x includes a redesigned data model, a reworked REST API, and a refreshed SDK ecosystem compared to the previous {registry} {registry-v2} release.
This section outlines the major changes between {registry} {registry-v2} and version 3.x so that you can plan your upgrade activities.

Because of the breaking changes in 3.x, there is no in-place upgrade. You must stand up a new 3.x deployment, migrate the persisted content, and update your client applications and automation.

When migrating to version 3.x, take the following areas into account:

== Updated data model and governance
{registry} 3.x separates artifact metadata from version metadata and introduces first-class support for empty artifacts. These capabilities let you prepare governance metadata, rules, and branch structures before the first version exists. Additional highlights include:

* Artifact metadata is now managed independently from version metadata.
* Groups and artifacts can define custom labels to improve categorization.
* Users can create and manage custom branches, and the `latest` branch is implemented as a system managed branch.

== Core v3 REST API
The v3 REST API focuses on consistency and discoverability:

* Group management now covers descriptions, owners, labels, and hierarchical rules.
* New search endpoints at `/search/groups` and `/search/versions` expand discovery.
* Version-focused endpoints streamline content management and require explicit `Content-Type` headers.
* A `dryRun` query parameter replaces the former `/test` endpoints.
* A dedicated Branch API enables multitrack artifact development.

== Re-engineered Kafka storage variant
The KafkaSQL storage implementation is now optimized for stability and maintainability.
The new design reduces startup times for large installations.

== Generated SDKs powered by Kiota
{registry} 3.x ships Kiota-generated SDKs that mirror the REST API structure across languages.
Updated libraries are available for Java, TypeScript, Python, and Go, providing lightweight, type-safe clients with minimal dependencies and consistent naming.

== Migrating {registry} data

[role="_abstract"]
Use the export and import APIs to migrate persisted content from {registry} {registry-v2} into a new {registry} 3.x deployment. The APIs preserve artifact identifiers, metadata, and references so that downstream Kafka payloads remain compatible.

{registry} 3.x accepts the export archive generated from a {registry-v2} instance. Capture the archive from your existing deployment, provision the 3.x environment, and import the archive into the new cluster.

.Prerequisites
* Running {registry} instances of the {registry-v2} server you are exporting from and the 3.x server you are importing into.
* Administrative credentials that allow access to the `/apis/registry/v2/admin/export` and `/apis/registry/v3/admin/import` endpoints.

.Procedure

. Export all data from {registry} {registry-v2}. The following command downloads `registry-export.zip` to your working directory:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X GET "http://old-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/admin/export" \
  -o registry-export.zip
----

. Import the archive into {registry} 3.x by posting it to the admin import endpoint:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST "http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3/admin/import" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --data-binary @registry-export.zip
----

. Validate the migrated content. Compare artifact counts between the legacy and new deployments:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl "http://old-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/search/artifacts"
----
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl "http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3/search/artifacts"
----
+
Check that global rules were imported successfully:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl "http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3/admin/rules"
----

[id="migrating-registry-applications_{context}"]
== Migrating {registry} client applications

[role="_abstract"]
Review every application that integrates with {registry} {registry-v2} to ensure compatibility with the v3 REST API, SDKs, and client libraries. Update dependency coordinates, reconfigure endpoints, and adjust automation to account for the new data model.

.Prerequisites
* Existing {registry} {registry-v2} applications that rely on the v2 REST API or legacy client libraries.
* Access to the source code or deployment configuration for each application you must update.

.Procedure
. Update your client configuration to target the v3 REST API base path:
+
[source,java]
----
String registryUrl = "https://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3";
RegistryClient client = RegistryClientFactory.create(registryUrl);
----
+
Automation that previously targeted `/apis/registry/v2` continues to function, but new functionality is only exposed through the v3 API.

. Refresh your client dependencies to the latest 3.x SDKs generated with Kiota. For Maven-based Java applications, use the new artifact identifier:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.apicurio</groupId>
    <artifactId>apicurio-registry-java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>{registry-release}</version>
</dependency>
----
+
Install the TypeScript, Python, or Go SDKs through the respective package managers (`npm install @apicurio/apicurio-registry-sdk`, `pip install apicurioregistrysdk`, or `go get github.com/apicurio/apicurio-registry/go-sdk`).

. Align your integration code with the reorganized endpoints:
* Manage artifact metadata at `/groups/{groupId}/artifacts/{artifactId}`.
* Retrieve or create content exclusively through `/versions` endpoints.
* Replace calls to `/test` endpoints with the `dryRun` query parameter.
* Use `/search/groups` and `/search/versions` where you previously enumerated artifacts indirectly.

. Adopt the branch API if you need parallel development streams. Branches allow you to promote or merge versions without duplicating artifacts.

. If you build Kafka SerDes integrations, verify that serializers and deserializers still reference the correct registry URL and consider enabling group- or artifact-level rules introduced in 3.x to enforce compatibility upstream.

[id="migrating-registry-configuration_{context}"]
== Updating {registry} configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Configuration keys in {registry} 3.x adopt a unified `apicurio.` namespace and reorganize authentication, eventing, UI, and storage settings. Review and update your deployment descriptors so that server-side properties match the new naming scheme.

=== Naming convention changes
Most configuration properties now start with the `apicurio.` prefix. The following examples illustrate common mappings:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Registry 2.x property
| Registry 3.x property

| `registry.auth.roles.admin`
| `apicurio.auth.roles.admin`

| `registry.events.kafka.topic`
| `apicurio.events.kafka.topic`

| `registry.rest.artifact.deletion.enabled`
| `apicurio.rest.deletion.artifact.enabled`
|===

=== Authentication and authorization
Authentication settings continue to rely on Quarkus OIDC support, but role-based properties moved to the new namespace. Update the property names and review any removed options:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Registry 2.x property
| Registry 3.x property

| `registry.auth.enabled`
| `quarkus.oidc.enabled`

| `registry.auth.role-source`
| `apicurio.auth.role-source`

| `registry.auth.anonymous-read-access.enabled`
| `apicurio.auth.anonymous-read-access.enabled`

| `registry.auth.oidc.client-id`
| `quarkus.oidc.client-id`

| `registry.auth.oidc.token-endpoint`
| `quarkus.oidc.token-path`
|===

[source,properties]
----
# Registry 2.x
registry.auth.enabled=true
registry.auth.roles.admin=admin
registry.auth.oidc.client-id=my-client

# Registry 3.x
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
apicurio.auth.roles.admin=admin
quarkus.oidc.client-id=my-client
----

=== Eventing and Kafka storage
Kafka-related settings now share the `apicurio.kafkasql` prefix. Update both event notifications and Kafka storage properties:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Registry 2.x property
| Registry 3.x property

| `registry.events.kafka.topic`
| `apicurio.events.kafka.topic`

| `registry.kafkasql.bootstrap.servers`
| `apicurio.kafkasql.bootstrap.servers`

| `registry.kafkasql.topic.auto-create`
| `apicurio.kafkasql.topic.auto-create`
|===

[source,properties]
----
# Registry 3.x example
apicurio.events.kafka.topic=my-registry-events
apicurio.kafkasql.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092
apicurio.kafkasql.topic=my-registry-storage
apicurio.kafkasql.topic.auto-create=true
----

== UI and API configuration
The UI configuration is now grouped under `apicurio.ui.*`, and API diagnostics align with the new hierarchy:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Registry 2.x property
| Registry 3.x property

| `registry.ui.contextPath`
| `apicurio.ui.contextPath`

| `registry.ui.features.readOnly`
| `apicurio.ui.features.read-only.enabled`

| `registry.ui.auth.oidc.redirect-url`
| `apicurio.ui.auth.oidc.redirect-uri`

| `registry.api.errors.include-stack-in-response`
| `apicurio.api.errors.include-stack-in-response`
|===

=== Storage and database configuration
Database settings moved out of the Quarkus datasource namespace. Update JDBC configuration and storage selection properties:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Registry 2.x property
| Registry 3.x property

| `quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`
| `apicurio.datasource.url`

| `quarkus.datasource.username`
| `apicurio.datasource.username`

| `registry.sql.init`
| `apicurio.sql.init`

| `registry.storage.kind`
| `apicurio.storage.kind`
|===

=== Migration checklist

. Inventory all configuration files, including deployment manifests and `application.properties`.
. Translate properties to their 3.x equivalents using the mappings in this section.
. Start a staging deployment of {registry} 3.x with the updated configuration and monitor logs for deprecated or unknown keys.
. Validate UI login flows, rule enforcement, and storage connectivity before promoting to production.

=== Common issues and resolutions
* *Authentication failures*: confirm that `apicurio.auth.roles.*` properties mirror the expected role names and that OIDC redirect URIs use the new property names.
* *Missing Kafka settings*: verify that all Kafka-related properties use the `apicurio.kafkasql` prefix and that optional settings removed in 3.x are not still present.
* *Database connection errors*: ensure you migrated JDBC settings out of the `quarkus.datasource.*` namespace and updated secrets or ConfigMaps accordingly.
